# Resume
Single page/ one-column plain text based resume of a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)/ QA Engineer.

Creating this repo to keep track of my resume and to make it easily editable. Initially I had my resume edited with Adobe Illustrator, which had some difficulty in editing. So wanted an easy to maintain resume, hence chose Latex template.

Feel free to fork and change as per your skillset.
