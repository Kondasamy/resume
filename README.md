# Resume
My single page/ one-column plain text based LaTeX resume.

Creating this repo to keep track of my resume and to make it easily editable. Initially I had my resume edited with Adobe Illustrator, which had some difficulty in editing. So wanted an easy to maintain resume, hence chose Latex template.

Feel free to fork and change as per your skillset.

# My toolset (VS Code editor)
1. I personally prefer `BasicTex` on Mac OS. Download [BasicTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html), or use `brew cask install basictex`. You can read more about BasicTex in [BasicTeX (pdf)](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/BasicTeX.pdf).
2. To manage LaTeX packages, I personally prefer GUI based `tex-live-utility`. You may find CLI tool `tlmgr` cumbersome to use, in that case install GUI for tlmgr - TeX Live Utility - `brew cask install tex-live-utility`.
3. Finally in Visual Studio Code, install the plugin [LaTeX workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop).

Done. You are good to go with editing of yuor LaTeX project.

*P.S:* Instead of restarting the terminal session, I would prefer to run the command `eval "$(/usr/libexec/path_helper)"` to make the brew installs effective in the same session.
